# ZFG
A VERY LIGHTWEIGHT tool to configure (and restart) zsh quickly

# Q&A (with myself)
## What's the point? All it is is an alias for 'vim ~/.zshrc'.
The point is the convenience of automatically restarting ZSH after making changes.
## What's up with that 'failure.zsh' file?
I tried to be ambitious and failed. Seriously, just run it for yourself (in zsh) and see what happens.
